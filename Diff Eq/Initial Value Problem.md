### I.V.P
#### $y'=f(t,y)$ 
#### $y(t_0)=y_0$ "initial condition"

Generally an ODE has infinitely many solutions, but an IVP only has one solution

Example:
$\frac{dy}{dt}=3t^2$
Take integral
$y=t^3+C \leftarrow$ general solution
plug in initial value into general solution
$y(0)=1$ 
$y(t)=t^3+1\leftarrow$ Particular solution
