##### $\frac{dy}{dt}$ = f(t, y)
Analytic Solutions:
A function y(t) is a solution for t in a domain D (any domain) if $\frac{dy}{dt}$ = f(t, y(t))

None Example
$\frac{dy}{dt}=y^2 -t$ 
This has no closed-form solutions (trig, exp, polynomial, rational)
**It has solutions but no simple ones** (This is most common)

$\frac{dy}{dt}=5y$ can be solved as $y(t)=e^{5t}$
can be generalized as $y(t)=Ce^{5t}$

Another example
$y'(t)=-\frac{t}{y}$ , (-1, 1)
Solution
$y(t)=(1-t^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$

### How do we understand solutions when we can't integrate 
**IDEA:** Look at the derivative

Example
$y\prime=t-y$
Draw a picture (slope field): Curves can not cross in unique solutions. 
Solutions appear to be defined for all time.
Exponential Growth as solutions seem to grow based on their size

**Concavity**
$y''=(t-y)'=1-y'=1-(t-y)$

### Equilibrium solutions
if y solves the D.E and $y'=0$ for all of $t, y$ is an equilibrium soln

Ex:
$\frac{dy}{dt}=y(1000-y)$
Equilibrium solutions are $y=0,y=1000$
Just graph the slope fields

An isodine of the DE $y'=f(t,y)$ is a curve in the ty-plane of the form $f(t,y)=m$ ($m$ is constant)

$m=0$ is a nullcline

Draw these isodies.
These are just lines where the slopes are the same
