Main Idea: A lot of mental processes seem to be computations

### What are computations?

Examples: 
- Following a recipe.
- Understanding what is in front of you when you see it
- Remembering a name
- choosing an options

Key features
- They take time
- They have inputs and outputs
- Inputs and outputs are both representations
- There are patterns to there transformations; not just any representation would count
- The pattern of the transformation can be characterized in mathematical or logical terms

A lot of our mental processes are logical or mathematical 
They involve logical interface or solving mathematical problems (whether consciously or unconsciously)

Mind is sometimes like a digital computer
