How should we study the mind:
We should study the mind as a systems of representations and of computations over those representations.

The mind is like clockwork, hydraulics, and electronic computers.
The mind being like Electronic computers is not a metaphor. Mental processes are computations.
Inputs in the form of representations, output in the form of other representations.

A lot of mental states seem to be representations and a lot of outputs seem to be representations.

Ordinary representations are things like maps, speedometers, and blueprints.

Key features of representations
- They are about things 
- About some conceivable state of affairs
	- Some times the concept is impossible
- Some representations are true/false while others are to be obeyed or disobeyed

[[Indicative Representations]] describe things
[[Imperative Representations]] are commands
