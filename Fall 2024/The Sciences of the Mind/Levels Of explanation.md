Need explanations in computations
 1. computation
 2. Representation/algorithm
 3. Implementation --> Neurons stuff

Get more detailed as you go from 1 --> 3

We need to answer all of these questions to have a good explanation

One theory of love. For A to love B, is for A is to desire what is best for B for B's own sake.

Love is really complicated and we do not understand love really well

We need three harmonizing representations of any mental phenomenon to understand it

Need what happens and how it happens

Implementation:
- How neurons in the body manage to embody these representations and manage to follow these algorithm
- What physical objects actually represent the states
	- Ex: on the mechanical calculator on wheels position in the physical representation of 0-9
- Scientists are skeptical that the changes in neurons are accurate enough to depict algorithms and individual representations

When it comes to love, we don't know the computation or the implementation
- We do know something about implementation
