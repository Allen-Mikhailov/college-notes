There are a lot of different mental states and processes. We can organize these into parts

Main Parts:
- perceptions
- beliefs
- memories
- desires
- plans
- choices

Perceptions, beliefs, memories are all indicative representations because:
- they are about things
- they are sometimes about things that are not real or impossible
- they are all true/accurate or false/inaccurate

Desires, plans, and choices are imperative representations because
- they are about things
- they are sometimes about things that are not real or impossible
- they can be obeyed/executed successfully or disobeyed/executed unsuccessfully
