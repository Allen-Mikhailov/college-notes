The mind is a system of representations and computations over that representations

A lot of people reject the idea that mental processes are computations because they believe in free will

Ex of computations:
- doing math

Many processes do not seem to be computations
- remembering

One possible reason is that the computations happen too fast
- visual stimuli that last less than 25-50 milliseconds do not make it into consciousness

Many processes that do not seem to be computations and they take more time
- Ex: taking a second to understand a sentence

One possible reason is that these processes are voluntary

The reason you dont notice most mental processes is that we are not representing those processes, and not representing has no feeling so we do not notice it.

Most processes feel free

Computations must be stable
