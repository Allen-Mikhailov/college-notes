More than 5 senses

Vision:
- Rods for black and white vision
- Cones for color vision
- Peripheral vision > 180 arc
- foveal vision > few degree arc
- Eye jumps around

Audition:
- Cochlear response : strength and location
- Allows us to represent location, movement, pitch, volume, shape, timbre
- Timbre is the difference between two sounds with the same volume and the same pitch

Somatosensation:
- mechanoreception: touch
- thermoception: heat/cold
	- cells are responsive to certain ranges

Olfaction:
- allows us to represent odorant qualities and intensities, also location

Equilibrioception:
- vestibular organ of the inner ear
- three loops (three axes)
- Allows us to represent our acceleration in three dimensions

Proprioception
- The ability to know where your limbs are in space without other senses

Azimuthal Angle
- Ability to hear where a sound comes from (angle)
- Not too accurate
- Interaural time difference
	- Time different as sound reaches one ear vs the other ear
- Interaural level difference
	- Volume difference as sound reaches one ear vs the other ear
- Inputs: value scaled from 1 to -1 of the time difference between sound arriving at the right ear vs left ear
- Output: angle to source
- Algorithmic Level
	- Input value represented as a value on a continuously variable scale ranging for max to min
	- Output value represented as a value on a continuously variable scale that can cycle around like degrees

Language:
- Languages all sound like idaudauwdguag if you do not understand them, but if you are familiar with the language you can make out the words in between the spaces
