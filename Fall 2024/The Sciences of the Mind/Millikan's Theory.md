### Representation
An [[Indicative Representations]] representation is a structure that must map onto the world in a way in order for some other structure to preform its function

An [[Imperative Representations]] is a structure such that some other structure performs its function by changing the world so that the first structures will then map (in a certain way) onto the new state of the world

Both parts of the theory rely on the idea that structures in the brain perform functions.

By saying that representations help us carry out out functions, she makes it clear how a false representation is an error or mistake. It is a representation not contributing to the job it has to do.

These functions had better not come from our own representations

Functions are derived from histories of natural selection.

Ex:
The heart
- the function of the heart is to pump blood
- If heart does not pump blood effectively you die or it is malfunctioning
