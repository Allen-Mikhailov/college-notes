We assume we act rationally most of the time, but things go wrong a lot still

There are two big sources of irrational action
- failure to use relevant mental states
- interference from irrelevant mental states

### failure to use relevant mental states
- failure to remember
- failure to draw relevant conclusion
- failure to give correct attention to some relevant stimulus or belief
- failure to deploy a relevant plan

### interference from irrelevant mental states
- habits, emotions, awareness of situations
