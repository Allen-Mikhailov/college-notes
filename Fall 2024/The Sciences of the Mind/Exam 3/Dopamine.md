Foraging behavior is a very good approximation for perfectly rational

How long-term learning and short term learning both use dopamine signaling in the brain

Dopamine has stuff to do with motivation/pleasure/reward based learning

Experiment:
- If reward came with no warning then dopamine increase when reward occurs
- If reward occurs after an arbitrary stimulus then dopamine increase after stimulus not after reward
- If stimulus occurs but no reward then dopamine and first then period of no dopamine at moment of expected reward

Reward prediction error
If expected reward it gave dopamine, but if the expected reward did not come it subtracted the dopamine

The dopamine system has inputs from many different brain structures that seem to be credible sites for the calculation of "actual reward" and "expected reward"

It also sends outputs to a lot of places such as the frontal lobe

What is the actual reward. Candidates:
- good things
- pleasure
- satisfaction
- desired things

Outputs from the system that go to the "striatum" are outputs that strongly influence action selection
some other outputs seem to be strongly related to pleasure
- there are clear relationships between stimulants and dopamine release/uptake
Outputs from the dopamine system also seem to be needed for developing new habits and new associations

It has to calculate
Actual X - expected X
