One might say that conscious logical reasoning is the very heart of rational action as it is what makes us flexible and responsive to evidence
It allows us to step back from impulses and ask "is this really something I have reason to do"

To deliberate we need to 
- Use sensory imagination (visualize, talk to yourself)
- fix or shift attention
- search your memory
- keep an idea in our mind

Deliberation is a kind of action
- it has a goal: (determine what to do, and want, and feel, and plan on)
- guides imagery, shifts of attention, memory searches, etc
- It can be done more of less rationally
It can be weak willed as you dont have to follow what you have deliberated
It can be done on command

Deliberation might somehow be the basis for rational action
Pure Philosophy to argue that it has to be wrong
Deliberation is based on a series of action that relies on beliefs and actions as inputs
Deliberation is an expression of that

Psychologists have long hypothesized about control mechanisms for visual imagination and auditory imagination
- Baddeley's "visuo-spatial sketchpad" and "phonological loop" are famous

Took a long time before people started asking what the internal process of for experiments

Baddeleys Model
- Phonological loop is when you ask yourself a question (you here yourself), and then you grasp whatever answer comes to you
- Visual Spacial Sketchpad - You can make visual imagery
- You have a central executive  that controls what you focus on, and chooses to use Visualization or Auditory
Neuroscience Evidence

In the dorsal basal ganglia
- For muscles there are motor outputs
- There are also Cognative outputs
- Also emotional outputs but they are not well defined
