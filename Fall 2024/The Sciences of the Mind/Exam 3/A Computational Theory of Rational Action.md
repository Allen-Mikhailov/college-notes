## Option 1:
inputs: beliefs and underived desires
outputs: actions
function: maximize satisfaction underived actions in the long run
Requires Amendments

## Better Options:
#### inputs: perceptions and beliefs, available basic actions, and underived desires each of these have weights to them
- perceptions are not beliefs as they come from different sections of the brain
- Senses can push you to rational action
- perception can act alone: You can avoid a bus before you believe it is a bus
- Output has to be a basic action so you must know your basic actions
- underived desires to not double count, they can stack if there are two underived desires
- belief: How sure you think it is true
- inputs may include separate input from prior intentions and knowledge of scripts (repeated like routines ): seem to be more like imperative representations (seem independent from belief)
#### Outputs: basic actions
- The actions specified by the commands that motor cortex and premotor cortex can issue (basic or slightly complex, Ex: reach to a target your eyes are already locked on, but not too complex Ex: call for a pizza)

An area of the brain that is capable of forming beliefs takes inputs from every sense.
"Belief is downstream from all your senses"

Any region of the brain that only takes input from one sense is considered a region for that sense. They also take input from action selection

underived desires: you dont want it to get something else
- You want food so you want a high paying job to get food
- Food is underived desire, High paying job is derived desire

#### Compute
- For each action compute the expected value that the action will bring
- The expected value is the sum of the chance that an action will bring about a underived desire times its weight
- Preform the basic action as this will attempt to maximize underived desires

#### Basic rundown
- Inputs: perception, belief, available basic actions, underived desires
- outputs: basic actions
- function maximize expected satisfaction of underived desires

Habits and Training are left out
they are how we are led to rational or irrational action

## Representation

Rank beliefs 0 to 1
Neurons go from 0 firing rate to maximum firing rate

It is really hard to calculate a maximum of expected utility
A lot of calculations of
- If I do A what are the chances that result 1 will follow, and how much do I want that
There is evidence that a lot of shortcuts are used, and that we only approximate it

Not every action is accessed (Not equally activated)
Not every underived desire us accessed

Has do be done very fast

Prior training will develop habits that will reduce or response times

Facing someone 1v1 in basketball requires improvisations, habits are not always used more improvisation
We can all have good conversation without relying on training

Neural Networks can help with this
