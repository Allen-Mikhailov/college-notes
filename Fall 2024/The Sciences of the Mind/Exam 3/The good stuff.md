On occasion we can be very good at maximizing 
Ex: move back to avoid getting hit by a bus

Questions:
- How common is it that we do this and how close do we get to being perfect
- Looking at foraging animals might help?
Animals have to make the choice:
- is it good enough right here or should I go search for food elsewhere
- No way to know for sure but we can make bets
Animals tend to be very good at optimizing  foraging. Birds eat worms that will give them the most energy most often

Semantic memory search seems close to foraging 
- When tested people asked to recall names of animal species show foraging like patterns

We are not very optimal
- You can change how many employees pay into a retirement plan by changing if it is opt-in or opt-out

When people first try to learn a new skill they often make a lot of stupid mistakes
- Training and Experience generally make these go away or way less common
