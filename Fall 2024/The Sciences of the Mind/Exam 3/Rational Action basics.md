Aristotle has distinguished  rationality in belief and rationality in action

Beliefs can be more rational or less rational
- Believing that I am attending rice university (more rational)
- Believing  that I know everything (less rational)
Actions are rational or irrational
- To know how rational something is you must know how it will maximize the desired satisfaction in the long run
- Do the best with  the evidence you have

Desires are what determines that the goal or priorities to be achieved by rational action
