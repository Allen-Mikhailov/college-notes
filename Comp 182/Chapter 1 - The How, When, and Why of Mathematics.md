## General Notes
Steps to solve problems:
1. Understand the problem
	- Make sure you understand everything about the problem. Every single word and what exactly you need to output. 
	- Draw a picture if needed. 
	- Check all conditions
2. Devising a plan
	- How will you attack the problem?
	- Have you seen anything like it before?
	- Problems often build on themselves 
3. Carrying out the plan
	- Solve the problem and look at your solution.
	- Make sure each sentence is true.
	- Come back to your solution after some time because it will be hard to spot errors at first
4. Looking back
	- Check the result and the argument or check with your teacher. You could also try looking for a different proof.
	- If you are allowed to work with others then you should switch proofs with your partner and give criticism 
	- Once you are sure that you are correct you should write up a solution that is nice and neat and correct
