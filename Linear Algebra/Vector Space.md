Vector space over the field R
$$
\mathbb{R}^n=
\left\{ 
\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
a_1 \\
a_2 \\
... \\
a_n
\end{array}
\right]
:a_1,a_2,...,a_n \in \mathbb{R}

\right\}
$$

### Vector Addition:
$[3, 2, 1], [-1, 0, 4] \in \mathbb{R}$
$[3, 2, 1] + [-1, 0, 4] = [2, 2, 5]$
w+v=v+w

### Scalar Multiplication
$[1, 2, 3] * 10 = [10, 20, 30]$

### Zero Vector
$$
\mathbb{R}^n=
\left\{ 
\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
0 \\
0 \\
... \\
0
\end{array}
\right]\in \mathbb{R}

\right\}
$$
It is usually denoted by **0** a bold zero but do note that **0** in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is not the same as $\mathbb{R}^4$.

### Visualization
Vectors can be visualized as arrows in space

Vector Spaces do not just have to be over the field $\mathbb{R}$ they can be over any field even over sets of matrixes and polynomials as long as they qualify as fields.
Vector Space Rules 
- Vector space is denoted as $V$ with the field $F$. The field $F$ is a non empty set in which you can do vector addition and scalar multiplication.
