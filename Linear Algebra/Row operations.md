There are three elementary row operations (All Reversable)
1. Multiply a row by a non zero scalar (multiplying by zero is non reversable)
2. Added a multiple of one row to another multiplied by a scalar
3. Swap two rows
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & ... & x_n & k
\end{array}
\right]
$$
These operations do not change solutions
