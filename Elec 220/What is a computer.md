Every computer has 5 key components
- Memory: stores data
- Input: Data to memory
- Output: Reads data from memory
- Control: sends the signals to determine the operations to fire
- Datapath: where we do the computations
Control and Datapath are referred to together as the processor
Applications are developed by compiling code
